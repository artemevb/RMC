In many countries, foreigners can purchase real estate only with the permission of local authorities or under a special license. Restrictions may pertain to the type of real estate: for example, foreigners may have the right to purchase only residential properties, not commercial or land. Also, foreigners must have a certain legal status, such as residents or investors. Often, proof of financial capability and sources of income is required, and there may be additional taxes or fees upon purchase. The purchase process may involve legal and administrative steps, such as notarial certification and registration of ownership rights. In some countries, there are regional or zone restrictions where foreigners can acquire real estate. For accurate information, it's best to consult local legal specialists or real estate agencies",
